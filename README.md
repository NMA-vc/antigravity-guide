# Antigravity Guide

The definitive guide to Google Antigravity: mission control for autonomous AI coding agents.

🌐 **Live Site:** [antigravity.md](https://antigravity.md)

## About

Google Antigravity is an AI-powered IDE that fundamentally reimagines software development. Instead of writing code line-by-line, you orchestrate autonomous agents that execute tasks asynchronously. This guide covers:

- The agent-first development paradigm
- Configuration (GEMINI.md vs AGENTS.md)
- Swarm development patterns
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- Skills architecture
- Production workflows (NotebookLM + Antigravity pipeline)

## What's Inside

- **Agent-First Philosophy** - Why Antigravity is different from Cursor/Copilot
- **Mission Control Interface** - Managing agent swarms effectively
- **Configuration Deep Dive** - GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, and context management
- **MCP Integration** - Connecting agents to external systems
- **Skills System** - Codifying best practices for reuse
- **Production Patterns** - Real workflows from experienced teams

## Key Topics

### The Paradigm Shift
Move from editor-centric development to agent orchestration. Your role changes from writer to architect, from debugger to manager of autonomous systems.

### Configuration
Understand the difference between GEMINI.md (Antigravity-native) and AGENTS.md (universal standard), and how to structure context for optimal agent performance.

### Swarm Development
Learn to run multiple specialized agents in parallel - one refactoring auth, another writing tests, a third debugging - all simultaneously.

### MCP Integration
Connect your agents to databases, Git, Slack, Linear, and more through the Model Context Protocol.

### Production Workflows
Master the NotebookLM + Antigravity pipeline and other battle-tested patterns from teams using agentic development.
